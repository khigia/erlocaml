Info:
    * External term format and distribution is now part of ERTS doc:
      http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/part_frame.html

Build/Distrib:
    * mlpack or mllib?
    * GODI
    * what about a common lib (mainly eterm) usable for F#

Test:
    * generic node_mult (like node_double, but allow config of operand:
      intend is to build mbox online and test a bit of concurrency).

Logging:
    * pa_log http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~cconway/tools/index.html

Look at:
    * Mbox could have a threaded version, a forked version (using pipe for communication), 
    * socket / concurrency
        * ocamlnet/equeue
        * jocaml
        * ocaml-event (libevent) http://www.xs4all.nl/~mmzeeman/ocaml
        * Ocaml-NAE (iom, cf) http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocnae
